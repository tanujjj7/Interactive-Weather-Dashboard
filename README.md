Project Title -
Interactive Weather Dashboard

Overview
This project is an interactive weather dashboard developed during my summer trainee internship at ADRDE (DRDO). The application provides real-time weather information and a 24-hour forecast for any city worldwide, combining data visualization with a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Features
Dynamic Background: The UI's background changes automatically to reflect real-time weather conditions, such as clear sky, clouds, rain, or a thunderstorm.

Real-time Data: Fetches and displays current weather metrics including temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, Air Quality Index (AQI), and UV Index using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Data Visualization: Interactive line charts, powered by Chart.js, visualize the 24-hour forecast for wind speed and humidity.

Interactive Map: An integrated map using Leaflet.js shows the exact geographical location of the searched city.

Responsive Design: The dashboard is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices.

Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (ES6+)
OpenWeatherMap API
Chart.js
Leaflet.js
